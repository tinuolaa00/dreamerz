    <li><p><i><u><a href="https://ociyu.org/">OCIYU</a></u> </i></p>
       <ul> OCIYU is an undocumented immigrant youth led organization that advocates
          for the rights of undocumented immigrants to live free from exploitation
          and persecution by mobilizing undocumented youth to advocate for their
          communities, and providing a space in which they can grow as leaders.</ul></li>
      <ul>
<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Dream Act</h2>
<p>The Dream Act(Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in the Senate by Senator Orrin Hatch as "Student Adjustment Act of 2001", is an American legislative Proposal for a multi-phase process for illegal immigrants in the United States.
This can grant conditional residency and if certain requirements are met, permanent residency.
</p>

<p>The Dream Act would provide a direct rode to U.S. citizenship for people who are either undocumented, have DACA(Deferred Action for Chilhood Arrivals)
or temporary protected status(TPS), and who graduate from U.S. high schools and attend college, enter the workforce, or enlist in a military program.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Who qualifies?</h2>
<p>
Those who are between the ages of 15 and 30 who are either in high school or already have high school diplomas. This group is immediately eligible for deffered action.
</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 5 and 14 who will be eligible at some point in the future if the deferred action initiative remains in place.
</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 15 and 30 who are not in high school and don’t have high school diplomas. Members of this group might be eligible for deferred action if they get a GED.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">Statistics</h3>
<p>

There are currently about 1.8 million immigrants in the United States who might meet the requirements of the deffered action initiative, either now or when they get older.

  <li>Make information and resources available to them.</li>
  <li>Don't make assumptions about which students are undocumented; they aren't all Latino,Spanish-speaking or enrolled in ESL classes.</li>
  <li>Identify scholarships that don't require citizenship or permanent residency.</li>

  <li>Help students get ongoing mentoring and advice, even after the college admissions process.</li>
