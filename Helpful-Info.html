<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Dream Act</h2>
<p>The Dream Act(Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in the Senate by Senator Orrin Hatch as "Student Adjustment Act of 2001", is an American legislative Proposal for a multi-phase process for illegal immigrants in the United States.
This can grant conditional residency and if certain requirements are met, permanent residency.
</p>

<p>The Dream Act would provide a direct rode to U.S. citizenship for people who are either undocumented, have DACA(Deferred Action for Chilhood Arrivals)
or temporary protected status(TPS), and who graduate from U.S. high schools and attend college, enter the workforce, or enlist in a military program.
</p>

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Who qualifies?</h2>
<p>
Those who are between the ages of 15 and 30 who are either in high school or already have high school diplomas. This group is immediately eligible for deffered action.
</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 5 and 14 who will be eligible at some point in the future if the deferred action initiative remains in place.
</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 15 and 30 who are not in high school and donâ€™t have high school diplomas. Members of this group might be eligible for deferred action if they get a GED.
