    <p style="font-size:20px"><right>The word DREAMer is in itself an acronym because the first part of the word (DREAM) stands for Development, Relief,
      and Education for Alien Minors. This comes from the DREAM Act which was first introduced to legislation in 2001 and
      was meant to provide a pathway to citizenship for people who were brought over to the United States as children and
      have grown up to be an American in every sense of the word <i>except</i> on paper.</right></p>

    <p style="font-size:20px"> Another legislation was introduced to during Obama's administration which was called DACA. This stood for Deferred
    Action for Childhood Arrivals and was proposed by Obama as an Executive order meaning presidents after him can rescind the
    act. The DACA act still does not lead to citizenship because it only allows for DREAMers to obtain a work visa. They can
    obtain a work visa by officially 'coming out' filling out an application and going through a background check.</p>

    <h2  style="color:navy;"><center>What is Happening Now? (Trump Administration)</center></h2>

    <p style="font-size:20px"> President Trump has made statements concerning the DACA Act which happen to be conflicting views. He has stated that
      he would get rid of DACA as soon as possible but people from his administration have also stated he has a "big heart"
      for these things. To further address his views on DACA is to note that there have been four incidents involving
      DREAMers since he has taken office. One of these incidents involved the accusation of gang acttivity against a DREAMer,
    having him detained and then released when finally proven false. On a seperate occasion another DREAMer was detained and
    deported in a short amount of time with no known cause. Due to the fact that the goverment has the information of
    countless DREAMers who have applied for DACA they have all the information they need to detain and deport those people.
    People from his administration including the presdient himself has thought of betraying that trust as described above.</p>
