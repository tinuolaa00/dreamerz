     <ul> OCIYU is an undocumented immigrant youth led organization that advocates
        for the rights of undocumented immigrants to live free from exploitation
        and persecution by mobilizing undocumented youth to advocate for their
        communities, and providing a space in which they can grow as leaders.</ul></li>

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Dream Act</h2>
<p>The Dream Act(Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors), introduced
   in the Senate by Senator Orrin Hatch as "Student Adjustment Act of 2001",
   is an American legislative Proposal for a multi-phase process for illegal immigrants in the United States.
This can grant conditional residency and if certain requirements are met, permanent residency.
</p>

<p>The Dream Act would provide a direct rode to U.S. citizenship for people
who are either undocumented, have DACA(Deferred Action for Chilhood Arrivals)
or temporary protected status(TPS), and who graduate from U.S. high schools
and attend college, enter the workforce, or enlist in a military program.

</p>

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">Who qualifies?</h2>
<p>
Those who are between the ages of 15 and 30 who are either in high school or already
 have high school diplomas. This group is immediately eligible for deffered action.
</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 5 and 14 who will be eligible at some point in the
  future if the deferred action initiative remains in place.
</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 15 and 30 who are not in high school and don’t have
  high school diplomas. Members of this group might be eligible for deferred action if they get a GED.

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">How you can help</h2>
<p>
There are many ways you can help but you can help by just doing this.</p>
<ol>
<h7><p>1. Tell undocumented students that they can go to college, but some options
  and services will not be available to them.</p>
<p>2. Make information and resources available to them.</p>
<p>3. Don't make assumptions about which students are undocumented; they aren't
   all Latino,Spanish-speaking or enrolled in ESL classes.</p>
<p>4. Identify scholarships that don't require citizenship or permanent residency.</li>
<p>5. Identify sponsors who can support undocumented students</p>
<p>6. Help students get ongoing mentoring and advice, even after the college
  admissions process.</p>
<p>7. Support the federal DREAM Act and respective state legislation to support
  undocumented students.</p>
<p>8. Identify older students to serve as role models</p>
<p>9. Refer students to qualified legal counsel to investigate possible
  immigration remedies.</p>
