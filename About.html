  <p id = "demo">I am a Mexican American who was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. When I was in 8th grade I was first introduced to computer science from a STEM program I was apart of. The teacher we had
  introduced us to HTML and CSS by having us use Mozilla Thimble. He assigned bellringers such as changing the text on a picture, changing the picture, changing the color of the background or text, and changing the font as well.</p>
